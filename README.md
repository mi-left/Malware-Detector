# Malware-Detector
### Prerequisites

Requires the Glob library in addtion to the libraries provided in the Docker container
```sh
pip install glob2
```
Requires **at least** 32 GB of RAM.

### Installation

* Train model using model.py
* All files must be in the same directory
* Line 19 of malware_detection.py has the testing boolean to False, which generates and saves new feature hashes when you run the program.  
    * Setting this to True would use the previously saved feature hashes.


## Usage

1. Run malware_detection.py
```sh
python3 malware_detection.py
```
2. Enter "p" to predict one or more executables
    - Input number of files
    - Input path to file, e.g. "./program.exe"
    - Keep inputting paths until number of files has been reached
    - Program will automatically store programs in an array

3. Enter "e" to evaluate array of (executable, label) pairs 
    - Input path to directory of benign files, e.g. "./benign_files/"
    - Repeat above for malware files
    - Program will automatically label files and create pairs itself
    - Please be patient. 
        - Program gets very slow with more files.  600 benign files and 300 malware files took ~15 min to process
